This XBRL parser takes advantage of structure to make it easier to find values from statements. Use search with multiple terms, exluding certain terms, and possibly by
its parent item. Get a list of certain search to track items over time.

The GAAP item that represents cash on a 10-Q or 10-K report can be called different things on the report that people read as well as in the instance document. One document
could have cash listed as "us-gaap:CashAndCashEquivalentsAtCarryingValue" while another has cash listed as "us-gaap:CashAndEquivalentsAtCarryingValue". The difference is trivial
but there's no way to adjust for this phenomenon across every report and every gaap item. Any gaap item could appear in multiple contexts in the report so even with the correct
tag to search for, it could still be possible to pull the correct values from a patchwork of different time periods. The context parser helps fix that.
